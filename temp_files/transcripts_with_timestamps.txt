[00:07] your brain is the most powerful weapon
[00:09] in the world once you put away your
[00:12] phones and your computers and all that
[00:14] we have nowadays that's great
[00:16] we're up-to-date you know you but your
[00:19] brain is the only thing you have when
[00:22] you're going through depression when
[00:25] you're going through hard times you're
[00:27] going through death real life you can't
[00:30] Google that man you're alone you're
[00:33] alone you may have a shrink you're going
[00:35] to you may have a best friend you going
[00:37] to but there's 24 hours in the day where
[00:40] you're alone in this brain and your
[00:42] brain is talking to you in all kind of
[00:44] ways and it wants to control you and
[00:46] pull you in these different pockets if
[00:48] you can't control your own brain and
[00:51] your brain controls you you're you got
[00:54] to tell your brain where you want to go
[00:55] and how you want to go and how you want
[00:57] to get there you got to control it if
[00:59] not it's over
[01:01] but existed for me was okay man how am I
[01:05] gonna make this work and all I knew back
[01:08] then was hard work the only way anything
[01:12] gets accomplished that's all I heard
[01:14] back in those days you got to work hard
[01:16] you got to work hard I'm not getting how
[01:19] did I can't get this paragraph I can't
[01:22] remember what this paragraph to pass
[01:24] this test to get the military breathe
[01:26] again
[01:26] I'm still not getting it read again but
[01:29] it's not getting it write it out and now
[01:31] I started learning okay well I can't I
[01:34] gotta write out everything I do and then
[01:37] write it out again and write it out
[01:38] again and guess what happened I got it I
[01:41] got it
[01:43] I can't swim I'm negative buoyant go
[01:45] back again I can't swim go back again go
[01:48] back again go back again I got it I
[01:53] realize if I keep going back and going
[01:56] back and going back until this just
[01:59] becomes your mind was safe okay we're
[02:03] gonna figure it out because he is not
[02:06] going to stop it's like I'm gonna try
[02:09] one more time no I'm gonna it's just
[02:12] like long clock goes off Boop we're
[02:15] going back I can't read right we're
[02:17] going back
[02:19] I gave myself no way out and my mind
[02:21] realized that they said okay we're gonna
[02:23] adapt and overcome now like a lot of
[02:28] people say trying hard they your mind
[02:32] knows man it knows this guy's bull guys
[02:35] lying there's no truth behind it when I
[02:38] was a Navy SEAL training people oh how
[02:39] are you there for 18 months the program
[02:42] is always six months long you were in
[02:43] three hell weeks in one year no one's
[02:46] ever done that how did you do that I
[02:48] talked about the new norm when I lived
[02:51] in the $7 a month place and I was
[02:53] growing up for a short period of time I
[02:55] loved it I don't know you know any
[02:58] different that was my norm once we move
[03:01] down that place we moved to $236 month
[03:04] place I was like I never want to go back
[03:06] to that little pieces but if you go back
[03:11] to that seven dollar month place and you
[03:14] realize this is where I live
[03:16] that's all I got your mind says Roger
[03:19] that this is home so when I was going to
[03:21] Navy SEAL training for 18 months and
[03:24] going back through all the hard part's
[03:27] over and over again I told myself after
[03:31] the first time I knew this could be a
[03:32] long journey there my body was breaking
[03:34] down it was it was just how it was going
[03:37] on I see know what this is my new normal
[03:39] so my mind said is that going to work
[03:41] like you go to work you put your suit I
[03:43] on I'm going to suffering every day
[03:46] every day suffering being broken duct
[03:49] taping my feet up stress fracture shin
[03:51] splints being broken this is my new norm
[03:54] and your mind says if we're not broken
[03:57] just say normal we got to be broken so
[04:01] then your mind starts to get tougher and
[04:03] tougher and more cast people huh how did
[04:05] you run on broken feet broken broken
[04:08] shins my mind knew this is how we
[04:11] operate we're a Navy SEAL training this
[04:14] is what we are I health and that became
[04:18] my new norm I gave myself no way out
[04:20] there was nothing outside these walls of
[04:22] hell nothing I became I love God but for
[04:26] a short period of time I became the
[04:28] devil because that was hell
[04:30] I became I became the boss the owner the
[04:33] CEO of Navy SEAL training that was my
[04:36] mindset and that's how you get through
[04:38] things you put yourself you immerse
[04:41] yourself wherever it is you become that
[04:44] you become that and give yourself
[04:46] nowhere yeah when I was tours in 97
[04:50] pounds and I was fat as hell trying to
[04:52] be a Navy SEAL the scariest thing in the
[04:55] world to me even to this day was that
[04:58] that could have been the rest of my life
[04:59] I thought then I was trying hard that's
[05:04] the scariest thing in the world I
[05:05] thought then two or 97-pound working for
[05:09] Ecolab's spraying for cockroaches making
[05:11] $1,000 a month I thought that was me at
[05:15] my 100% potential come to find out a few
[05:20] years later I wasn't even near that 106
[05:25] pounds less graduating Navy SEAL
[05:27] training we don't do all these other
[05:28] things looking back on that that was me
[05:31] trying hard that's why people got
[05:34] understand what is in us we have no idea
[05:38] until we start trying hard and I mean
[05:41] really trying hard where you're obsessed
[05:43] with hey this is my new norm my new norm
[05:47] is that wow this isn't always fun it's
[05:50] not always meant to be fun and that's
[05:54] when you know you're trying hard
[05:56] people hear my story and think this
[05:58] guy's sadistic I realize how the how the
[06:02] brain works I figured out how the brain
[06:05] works I'm a scared kid and that's what
[06:09] gives me so much power
[06:10] I had no foundation and I built this off
[06:14] of just researching the mind the feeling
[06:18] you get is basically invincibility you
[06:23] realize that you can't do it all the
[06:27] time when you need to do it I know I can
[06:30] go to a place that I can live in and
[06:33] when you know that you can run on broken
[06:37] legs and you can do certain things that
[06:39] a lot of people can do but they're not
[06:41] willing to do this power this
[06:45] sympathetic nervous system of fight or
[06:47] flight and you're fighting it gives you
[06:51] this charge of energy over when you're
[06:54] sitting there at 3:30 4:00 o'clock in
[06:55] the morning and you're duct taping your
[06:57] feet up because they're broken and
[07:00] you're doing it by yourself and you're
[07:03] going to do arguably one of the hardest
[07:05] training in the world and these guys
[07:07] most of them are healthy and you're
[07:09] going through it broken and you already
[07:12] at a disadvantage but you're still there
[07:15] you can feed into that and tap into that
[07:18] for a lot of power but if you look at it
[07:21] while I'm broken man like I'm not gonna
[07:24] make it if you look at it as man I'm
[07:27] broken and I'm still here and I'm
[07:29] fighting and I'm gonna find a way to get
[07:31] through this because I have no other
[07:33] place to go it gives you a lot of power
[07:37] when things start to suck really really
[07:41] bad my brain and a lot of people's brain
[07:45] DUP they don't go to your dad beating
[07:47] you up your brain says win it right here
[07:50] this is miserable so anger goes away a
[07:54] lot of times when you're suffering
[07:56] because your brain that says we got a
[07:58] run we got to go so that anger is not
[08:01] popping up saying oh I'm gonna
[08:03] show them I want to show those people no
[08:06] there has to be a much deeper if I say
[08:09] deeper it has to be down to mineral
[08:12] mineral soil it has to be down to that
[08:16] nice mineral soil where nothing can burn
[08:18] you can't burn dirt so it has to be down
[08:23] that low that literally is submenu
[08:26] that's at the core your soul
[08:28] and but you but you don't find it unless
[08:32] you spend a lot of time with what you
[08:35] want to be in life you I can't give that
[08:38] to you right you can't give it to
[08:40] somebody when when you find your true
[08:43] passion in life and my passion for me
[08:45] when like I want to be now given my Navy
[08:47] SEALs I mean roundish I want to serve my
[08:49] country I cared about I want to be
[08:52] someone that I'm proud of I want to look
[08:55] at myself in American I was so
[08:57] disappointed
[08:58] that accountability man I talked about I
[09:00] was so disappointed in what I saw every
[09:04] day
[09:04] I want everybody to love David Goggins
[09:07] and a lot of people did I didn't love
[09:12] myself
[09:13] but I knew a lot of us want to find
[09:16] peace first so gonna say man you always
[09:19] talk about this suffering and pain
[09:20] --is-- I'm at peace right now because
[09:23] I'm going to do that you don't find
[09:25] peace first if you do Merry Christmas
[09:28] more power to you more power to you
[09:31] I found peace on the opposite end of
[09:36] finding myself and no one really finds
[09:40] himself without going through trials
[09:43] tribulations suffering accountability
[09:46] and accountability is suffering being
[09:50] accountable every day for doing right
[09:53] for yourself for the people next to you
[09:55] it's miserable it's hard so you know
[09:58] even the smallest details
[10:11] you
