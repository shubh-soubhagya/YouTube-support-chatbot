[00:00] winning an Oscar ages you hello there
[00:07] thank you for having me back it's such a
[00:09] pleasure to be here last year was the
[00:12] best night of my husband's life
[00:22] he actually says that and I've given
[00:25] birth three times
[00:32] so I I hope you're all having as good a
[00:35] time as he did and decided um I don't
[00:39] want to keep you from the bar much
[00:41] longer I know I'm supposed to talk about
[00:44] acting and find some clever thread
[00:45] connecting these performances but their
[00:48] beauty and brilliance surely lies in the
[00:50] fact that there isn't one and I'm sorry
[00:52] that all these men can't win here are
[01:01] the nominees for performance by an actor
[01:04] in a leading role
[01:06] Antonio Banderas Payne and Hillary

[01:12] Leonardo DiCaprio once upon a time in
[01:15] Hollywood

[01:39] toca this is the first Oscar and fourth
[01:47] nomination for Joaquin Phoenix
[01:49] [Applause]
[01:50] [Music]
[01:51] [Applause]
[01:56] I gotta move so much data too right now
[02:06] uh and I do not feel elevated above any
[02:11] my fellow nominees or anyone in this
[02:14] room because we share the same love that
[02:18] the love of film and this form of
[02:21] expression has given me the most
[02:24] extraordinary life I don't know what I'd
[02:27] be without it but I think the greatest
[02:30] gift that it's given me and many of us
[02:33] in this room is the opportunity to use
[02:35] our voice for the voiceless I've been
[02:39] thinking a lot about some of the
[02:42] distressing issues that we are facing
[02:45] collectively and I think at times we
[02:49] feel or were made to feel that we
[02:52] champion different causes but for me I
[02:56] see commonality I think whether we're
[03:01] talking about gender inequality or
[03:04] racism or queer rights or indigenous
[03:08] rights or animal rights we're talking
[03:10] about the fight against injustice we're
[03:12] talking about the fight against the
[03:13] belief that one nation one people one
[03:16] race one gender or one species has the
[03:19] right to dominate control and use and
[03:22] exploit another with impunity I think
[03:35] that we've become very disconnected from
[03:37] the natural world and many of us what
[03:40] were guilty of is an egocentric
[03:42] worldview the belief that were the
[03:45] center of the universe we go into the
[03:47] natural world and we plunder it for its
[03:50] resources we feel entitled to
[03:53] artificially inseminate a cow and when
[03:56] she gives birth we steal her baby even
[04:00] though her cries of anguish are
[04:01] unmistakable and then we take her milk
[04:05] that's intended for a calf and we put it
[04:07] in our coffee and our cereal
[04:09] and I think we fear the idea of personal
[04:14] change because we think that we have to
[04:16] sacrifice something to give something up
[04:18] but human beings that our best are so
[04:22] inventive and creative and ingenious and
[04:24] I think that when we use love and
[04:29] compassion as our dieting principles we
[04:32] can create develop and implement systems
[04:36] of change that are beneficial to all
[04:37] sentient beings and to the environment
[04:39] now I've been I've been a scoundrel in
[04:45] my life I've been selfish I've been
[04:48] cruel at times hard to work with and
[04:51] ungrateful but so many of you in this
[04:54] room have given me a second chance and I
[04:57] think that's when we're at our best when
[05:00] when we support each other not when we
[05:02] cancel each other out for past mistakes
[05:04] but when we help each other to grow when
[05:07] we educate each other when we guide each
[05:09] other towards redemption that is the
[05:11] best of humanity
[05:18] I just um
[05:22] when you when he was up when he was when
[05:28] he was 17 my brother wrote over this
[05:31] lyric he said run to the rescue with
[05:34] love and peace will follow thank you
[05:37] [Applause]
