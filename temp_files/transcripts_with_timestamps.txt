[00:11] Wow,
[00:13] what an audience.
[00:14] But if I'm being honest,
I don't care what you think of my talk.
[00:18] I don't.
[00:19] I care what the internet
thinks of my talk.
[00:21] (Laughter)
[00:22] Because they are the ones
who get it seen and shared.
[00:24] And I think that's where
most people get it wrong.
[00:26] They're talking to you, here,
[00:28] instead of talking to you,
random person scrolling Facebook.
[00:34] Thanks for the click.
[00:36] You see, back in 2009,
[00:37] we all had these weird little things
called attention spans.
[00:41] (Laughter)
[00:42] Yeah, they're gone. They're gone.
We killed them. They're dead.
[00:46] I'm trying to think of the last time
I watched an 18-minute TED talk.
[00:50] It's been years, literally years.
[00:52] So if you're giving
a TED talk, keep it quick.
[00:55] I'm doing mine in under a minute.
[00:57] I'm at 44 seconds right now;
[00:59] that means we've got
time for one final joke.
[01:01] Why are balloons so expensive?
[01:04] (Audience) "Why?"
[01:05] Woody Roseland: Inflation.
[01:06] (Laughter)
[01:08] (Applause)
